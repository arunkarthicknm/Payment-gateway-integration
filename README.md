* A simple Responsive website where payment gateway is integrated.

* There will be a simple donate button on the homepage. On clicking the donate button,
the user can select the choice of a gateway,
then the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc.

* Once the payment is done an invoice will be generated and an email will be sent to the user
for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount.
